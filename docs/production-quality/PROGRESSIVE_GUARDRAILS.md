# Progressive Guardrails System

> **Wide to Narrow: From Exploration to Precision**

This document defines the guardrail system that progressively narrows from open exploration to precise implementation. Each phase tightens constraints while preserving creative problem-solving within defined boundaries.

• "Describe your ideal customer's day"
• "What emotions should your brand evoke?"

## Decisions That CAN Change

Everything. Nothing is locked yet.

## Exit Criteria (Loose)

- [ ] Have some sense of brand identity
- [ ] Collected inspiration materials
- [ ] Know who the target audience might be
- [ ] Have directional color/tone preferences

### Phase 6+: Development to Production

**Guardrail Width: NARROWEST (10%)**

```markdown
## What's ALLOWED

✅ Implementing tasks as specified
✅ Following established patterns
✅ Writing tests per requirements
✅ Bug fixes within scope
✅ Performance optimization
✅ Minor code improvements

## What's STRICTLY CONSTRAINED

⚠️ Must follow architecture exactly

## What's NOT ALLOWED

❌ ANY scope changes without formal process
❌ ANY new features
❌ Deviating from architecture
❌ Creating new patterns without approval
❌ Skipping tests

• "Is this within the scope of my task?"
• "Have I written tests for this?"
• "Does this need a change request?"

## Change Request Process

For ANY deviation from plan:

1. Document the requested change
2. Assess impact on timeline/scope
3. Get stakeholder approval
4. Update requirements/architecture if needed
5. Re-estimate affected work
6. Only then proceed

## Decisions That CAN Change (With Process)

- Minor implementation details
- Code organization (within patterns)

## Decisions That Are LOCKED

- [ ] Follows all patterns
- [ ] PR created with checklist

Testing:
- [ ] All test types passing
- [ ] Coverage targets met
- [ ] No critical bugs

Security:

## Guardrail Enforcement Rules

### How to Handle Requests That Violate Guardrails

```markdown
## Response Framework

### When asked to revisit a LOCKED decision:

1. ACKNOWLEDGE the request
2. EXPLAIN what phase locked that decision
3. OFFER the change request process (if applicable)
4. REDIRECT to current phase focus

### Example Responses:

**"Can we change the tech stack?"** (During Development)
→ "The tech stack was locked in Phase 2 (Conception).
   Changing it now would require a formal change request
   with full impact assessment. Would you like to proceed
   with that process, or shall we continue with the current
   implementation?"

**"Let's add this feature"** (During Development)
→ "Feature scope was frozen in Phase 3 (Requirements).
   This would be a great addition for V2. I'll add it
   to the backlog. For now, let's focus on completing
   the current sprint."

**"What if we targeted a different audience?"** (During Planning)
→ "Target audience was defined in Phase 0 (Brand Discovery)
   and locked in Phase 2. Changing it would require revisiting
   all subsequent decisions. Is there a specific concern about
   the current audience that we should address?"
```

### The "10% Flex" Rule

Even at the narrowest phase, 10% flexibility remains:

```markdown
## Allowed Flexibility

✅ Implementation approach within task
✅ Variable/function naming (within conventions)
✅ Minor refactoring of own code
✅ Additional test cases
✅ Documentation improvements
✅ Performance optimizations (that don't change behavior)

## NOT Flexibility

❌ Changing what the feature does
❌ Adding features not in scope
❌ Creating new patterns
❌ Changing data models
❌ Modifying APIs
❌ Affecting other tasks
```

## Quick Reference Card

### "Can I change...?" Decision Tree

```
Is the request about something from a PREVIOUS phase?
  │
  ├─ YES → Is it a minor clarification?
  │          │
  │          ├─ YES → Allow (document it)
  │          │
  │          └─ NO → Requires Change Request Process
  │                   1. Document change
  │                   2. Assess impact
  │                   3. Get approval
  │                   4. Update affected artifacts
  │
  └─ NO → Is it within current phase scope?
           │
           ├─ YES → Allow (within current guardrails)
           │
           └─ NO → Defer to appropriate future phase
                   or add to backlog
