|---|-------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Application Name** | ✅ | - |
| 2 | **Company Name** | ✅ | - |
| 3 | **Author Name** | ✅ | - |
| 4 | **License Type** | ✅ | Proprietary |
| 5 | **Contact Email** | ✅ | - |

### Template: Project Identity

```markdown
## Project Identity

| **Author Name** | [Primary author/creator] |
| **License Type** | Proprietary |
| **Copyright Year** | 2025 |
| **Contact Email** | [email@example.com] |
```

### Generated Artifacts

After capturing identity, automatically generate:

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Zero downtime
- Instant rollback
- Resource intensive

### Canary Deployment
- Gradual rollout (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
- Risk mitigation
- Requires traffic splitting

### Rolling Deployment
- Gradual instance updates
- No additional resources
- Partial rollback possible
```
